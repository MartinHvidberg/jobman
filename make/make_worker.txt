Expect to make a seperate workdir for each seperate production, e.g. "Slope a million tiles"
There should alway be a workdir per masterdir. (as of JobMan ver.1.x)

In the following 'the worker' is the user that will later be running JobMan from this dir

Establish a workdir on a local drive, where 'the worker' can be granted Read access
workdir = /

put in this dir
/jobman.config
/jobman.py

Establish a workers_dir, where 'the worker' can be granted Read and Write access 
and that 'the worker' my empty at will (you don'r keep stuff there...)
workers_dir = /workers

copy /masterdir/Executables to /workdir/Executables

Adjust .config to reflect the dirs, hardware, etc. on your local computer...

Your workdir structure will now look like this, 
where somefile.x is an executable, copied from /masterdir that 'the worker' can run
where R, W and X indicat the Read, Write and eXecute privilidges of 'the worker'.
