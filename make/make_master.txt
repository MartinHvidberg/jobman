Expect to make a seperate masterdir for each seperate production, e.g. "Slope a million tiles"

Establish a masterdir on a shared drive, where all workers can be granted Read and Write access

masterdir = /

Create the following directories
/Available
/Busy
/Completed
/Discarded
/Executables
/Logging
