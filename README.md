I had a calculation that just took too long.
Dividing the input data in 16 pieces, and ran the calculation in parallel in 16 individual command line windows (dos-prompts), it still took three weeks.

Around the office were many computers, similar to mine, and idle for most of the time. So why not divide the calculation into 100, or 1000 pieces, and then set up a system, allowing all these computers could request packets of calculation, and do the work for me... That’s how “jobman” started.
